# CS741-IITBOMBAY
Assignments of Advanced Network Security &amp; Cryptography ( Spring Course 2021 IIT Bombay )


Assignment 1:

Browser Extension - block XSS whole script injection, Simple AdBlock

Assignment 2:

1. A program to compute the bias of each combination of inputs and outputs to/from the AES S-Box
2. A program to obtain a linear expression with the maximum possible bias

Project:

We analysed a software-based side-channel attack from a malicious SGX enclave targeting
co-located enclaves.
In this attack the malware runs on the SGX hardware, abusing SGX protection features to conceal
itself. A Prime+Probe cache side-channel attack is performed on a co-located SGX enclave running
RSA implementation that uses a constant time multiplicative primitive.
